# Lime Contribution Guidelines

The Lime Programming Language accepts contribution from anyone, in three of different ways.

## Method 1 — Discussions

Discussions are to be used when one has a question about Lime that may benefit the whole Lime community. A new discussion must only be opened if a previos discussion does not answer the question fully.

## Method 2 — Issues

Issues are to be used when one identifies that Lime is behaving unexpectedly or when one identifies a gap in the functionality of Lime that could be addressed.

## Method 3 — Pull Requests and Code Cntribution

Pull Requests are to be used to address open issues by contributing working code to Lime. A pull request must always be preceded by an issue (see Method 2) that it attempts to fix.
