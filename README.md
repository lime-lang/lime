# The Lime Programming Language

## About

Lime is a programming language that attempts to bridge the gap between programming and mathematics. Rather than knowing the value of ever variable at all times, Lime can use different expressions to figure out values, much like in Mathematics.

## Examples

### Simultaneous Equations

```py
# Input

y = 5x + 2
y = x + 2

# Output
y = 0
```

### Quadratic Equations

```py
# Input

y = 2x^2 - 16x - 130

# Output
y = 5
y = -13
```
